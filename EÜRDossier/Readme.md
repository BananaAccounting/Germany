## Project understanding

#### Objective
Create a complete offering for DATEV/ Steuerberater dominated German market  

#### User story epic
Use Banana for small business/ Vereins-/ private bookkeeping/ accounting, in order to self-reliantly control, analyse and plan financial activities. A typical user would want to cooperate with a Steuerberater for end of year tax purposes.

## Roadmap

#### Potentially shippable product increments
* Complete accounting files for Einnahmeüberschußrechnung, with headers and groups for structuring the report, a complete VAT table with 3/4-digit tax codes for all the possible cases
* The files contains all the relevant DATEV and ELSTER data/information for creating reports/ exports. It is ready so that app development could start any time. The file also show ELSTER-SKR03 Zuordnung for creating a EÜR-report

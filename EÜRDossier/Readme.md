# Einnahmeüberschussrechnung

The following shall give an overview of the current status of the initial roadmap we defined in Lugano in december

## Project understanding

#### Objective
Create a complete offering for DATEV/ Steuerberater dominated German market  

#### User story epic
Use Banana for small business/ Vereins-/ private bookkeeping/ accounting, in order to self-reliantly control, analyse and plan financial activities. A typical user would want to cooperate with a Steuerberater for end of year tax purposes.  

#### Product backlog
1. Get accounting plans
2. Bananaapp
3. Presentation of the product completed  

--> all tested that they are what people need

## Roadmap

#### Results form last work period
* Complete accounting files for Einnahmeüberschußrechnung, with headers and groups for structuring the report, a comprehensive VAT table with codes for all the possible cases and a printed EÜR report. The accounting plan comes in different versions. Also a template for Anlagenbuchhaltung
* The files contains all the relevant DATEV and ELSTER data/information for creating reports/ exports. It is ready so that app development could start any time. The files also show ELSTER-SKR03 Zuordnung for EÜR/UStVA
* A proposal for a structure and a detailed agenda for a user tutorial/ guide for German market region

Moreover, I have put together relevant information concering end of year ELSTER forms, DATEV systematics, account funcionality attributions or marketing issues

#### Working output, overview of repository

Working results and materials are organized in 4 folders, each representing a seperate project branch

**1. Accounting files**      
**2. EÜR Reports (BananaApps)**      
**3. Guide/ Content for German users (presentation of product)** and       
**4. Considerations for promoting Banana in Germany (without paying for ads)**   

Each folder contains a readme presenting a roadmap for the project branch, with

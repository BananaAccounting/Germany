# Roadmap Banana content for Germany region

I understand from our discussions that you imagine a kind of Banana introduction for German users. It would be placed in the regional section for Germany on the Banana webstite.

In this folder, I propose a detailed structure of what I think is useful for German users to get as information in order to get quick started with Banana in a DATEV/Steuerberater conform way.

# Branch Roadmap - Promotion and Marketing in Germany (without paying advertising)


## Objective
Increase publicity (Bekanntheit) of Banana in Deutschland. Simply increase the likelihood that someone who looks for accounting software simply stumbles over Banana and says: "Hey, whats that? Oh, I can download and try it out!"

In a first step, it's not about paying for ads. It's about getting mentioned and displayed for free where it's appropriate and where the target group hangs around and researches information.


## Get Banana mentioned for free on multiplier sites:

In file [Multiplikatoren_Websites.xls](https://github.com/RobertUlb/Germany/blob/patch-1/E%C3%9CRDossier/4_Promotion%20and%20Marketing/Multiplikatoren_Websites.xls "Multipliers"), I have compiled intesting Website that seem to be frequented by our target group or simply publishes about accounting/ financial software. A lot of these information I have collected 2014, and I have updated some of it, especially resellers

The objective is to get Banana listed in a maximum number of independent directories/ listings where also closest competitors like Lexware or Monkey are on display.

Priority list for contact targets

1. Resellers: Get Banana listed amongst their offerings
2. Test & Download Sites: Banana tested agaings competitors, Banana test versions for free download
3. Recommendations: Banana mentioned or recommended in information sites relevant to founders and entrepreneurs

In my view it makes sense to get in contact with multiplier sites to check possibilities/ conditions that Banana is mentioned/ listed. For a start, I would select 10 resellers and 10 download sites, work them off and see what we get as feedback and informations.

Further steps would be based on these first feedbacks

## Further (non-paying) promotional opportunities

#### Involve Learners of Accounting
We discussed that students are an interesting target group. It could be interesting, to find ways to approach this group and promote Banana as a means for learning accounting. Professors/ scholars for accounting could be an interesting group of multipliers, too.

#### Steuerberater
We also discussed that you would like to have a list of Steuerberater on Banana site, as Banana partners, eg. one in each Bundesland


## Tradeshow/ Congress for Finance/controlling software

Could be an intersting visit. This year as visitor, to see how it is and what it's really about. And maybe next year as a participant, with a prepared offering and booth and a speakers opportunity?
The show/ conference takes place in Fulda 9.-11. Mai 2019

## Estimated workload
* for contacting 20 addresses (phone/mail), get through to the right counterpart, plus subsequent communication process. Where possible, achieve getting listed
* Contact professors for accounting and get at least 1 to test and give feedback on Banana software in the context of learning/ university purposes. Investigate more closely at one universitiy among students
* presentation of results of this first step    

5 Working days (ca. 40h)


## Lomgterm perspective
* Banana placed in all relevant sources (1+2)
* Banana always listed among competitors like Lexware, Monkey etc. when relevant software is tested and compared. Others would then write about Banana
* Watch, study, follow carefully user feedback on these sites. Draw recommendations for further developping the German Banana offering
* Get more Steuerberater to work with Banana customers. Get them listed on Banana website

Non of these measures have to be paid. All these are activities that just involve a working resource, a qualified person who takes care of it.

Additional paid options:
* SEO
* Banner advertising (paid) on sites where entrepreneurs and small business owners research for information (3)
* Google ads

# Branch Roadmap - Promotion and Marketing in Germany without paying advertising


## Objective
Increase publicity (Bekanntheit) of Banana in Deutschland. Simply increase the likelihood that someone who looks for accounting software simply stumbles over Banana and says: "Hey, whats that? Oh, I can download and try it out!"

In a first step, it's not about paying for ads. It's about getting mentioned and displayed for free where it's appropriate and where the target group hangs around and researches information.


## Get Banana mentioned for free on multiplier sites:

In file [Multiplikatoren_Websites.xls](https://github.com/RobertUlb/Germany/blob/patch-1/E%C3%9CRDossier/4_Promotion%20and%20Marketing/Multiplikatoren_Websites.xls "Multipliers"), I have compiled intesting Website that seem to be frequented by our target group or simply publishes about accounting/ financial software. A lot of these information I have collected 2014, and I have updated some of it, especially resellers

Priority list for contact targets

1. Resellers: Get Banana listed amongst their offerings
2. Test & Download Sites: Banana tested agaings competitors, Banana test versions for free download
3. Recommendations: Banana mentioned or recommended in information sites relevant to founders and entrepreneurs

In my view it makes sense to get in contact with multiplier sites to check possibilities/ conditions that Banana is mentioned/ listed. For a start, I would select 10 resellers and 10 download sites, work them off and see what we get as feedback and informations


## Tradeshow/ Congress for Finance/controlling software

Could be an intersting visit. This year as visitor, to see how it is and what it's really about. And maybe next year as a participant, with a prepared offering and booth and a speakers opportunity?
The show/ conference takes place in Fulda 9.-11. Mai 2019

## Estimated workload
for contacting 20 addresses, get through to the right counterpart, plus subsequent communication process and presentation of results of this first step:
4-5 Working days (ca. 30-40h)


## Lomgterm perspective
* Banana placed in all relevant sources (1+2)
* Banana among competitors when relevant software is tested and compared. Others would then write about Banana
* Watch and study user feedback on these sites, draw recommendations for further development of the offering

Lateron
* SEO
* Banner advertising on sites where entrepreneurs and small business owners research for information (3)

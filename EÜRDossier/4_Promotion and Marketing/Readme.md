# Roadmap Promotion and Marketing in Germany without paying advertising

### Objective
Increase publicity (Bekanntheit) of Banana in Deutschland. Simply increase the likelihood that someone who looks for accounting software simply stumbles over Banana and says: "Hey, whats that? Oh, I can download and try it out!"

In a first step, it's not about paying for ads. It's about getting mentioned and displayed for free where it's appropriate and where the target group hangs around and researches information.

### Get Banana mentioned for free on multiplier sites:

In file [Multiplikatoren_Websites.xls](https://github.com/RobertUlb/Germany/blob/patch-1/E%C3%9CRDossier/4_Promotion%20and%20Marketing/Multiplikatoren_Websites.xls "Multipliers"), I have compiled intesting Website that seem to be frequented by our target group or simply publishes about accounting/ financial software. A lot of these information I have collected 2014, but I have updated some of it.

Priority list for contact targets

1. Resellers: Get Banana listed amongst their offerings
2. Test & Download Sites: Banana tested agaings competitors, Banana test versions for free download
3. Recommendations: Banana mentioned or recommended in information sites relevant to founders and entrepreneurs

In my view it makes sense to get in contact with multiplier sites to check possibilities/ conditions that Banana is mentioned/ listed. For a start, I would select 10 resellers and 10 download sites, work them off and see what we get as feedback and informations

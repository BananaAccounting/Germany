# Roadmap ELSTER Reports

### BananaApp ELSTER Umsatzsteuervoranmeldung 2016/2018 and current accounting files templates for Germany

Banana has already implemented a Banana app for UStVA. ELSTER recently changed the interface so that the app apparantly doesn't work for 2019. The current status and implementation options should be discussed more in detail, as well as the current templates in use.


**EÜR_Reference_with UStVA.ac2**

is the reference accounting file where I additionally added a seperate table to illustrate an idea for an alternative way to implement ELSTER reports in Banana. Please consider this idea as purely conceptual, from a user perspective. I cannot judge if this idea is realistic to be implemented: Instead of a Banana App a user would add new tables for the ELSTER report desired (Werkzeuge-->Neue Funktion hinzufügen). Each tables would represent an ELSTER form (eg. EÜR, UStVA, USt Erklärung etc). The table would link Kennzahlen to the corresponding accounts in Kategorien and calculate the sums/ amounts for each Kennzahl (is this possible?). The print-out would be done from this table.



### Next steps

* Elster implementation to be discussed more in detail
* Resources for implementation?
